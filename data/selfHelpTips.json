        "If you don't measure your time, it's tough to stop procrastination or improve your productivity. Because if you want to manage your time better, you have to know where it goes first. Your memory is not sufficient. If I asked you what you were doing exactly one week ago at this time, would you have an answer? There you go. How do you know your time? Keep an activity log. Before I even have a real session with clients, I often ask them to keep an activity log for two weeks. An activity log is exactly what you imagine — an hour by hour record of what you're doing throughout the day.",
        "This step is actually very simple. I just have one question for you:“Go through all the  recurring activities in your log one by one. What would happen if you would stop doing them?” If the answer is: “All hell breaks loose.” Don't change anything. But if your answer is: “Nothing would happen.” You've hit gold. We all do activities that have ZERO return. I call those activities time-wasters."

        "Boom. That's it. Know where your time goes. Identify the critical tasks from the trivial tasks in your life. And cut the trivial, time-wasting, tasks. “That simple?” Yes. If you want to be a super effective person, you regularly keep a log. You don't have to keep a log for 365 days a year. Instead, do two stretches of two-three weeks a year. That's enough to keep track of your time and identify new time-wasters. Also, the additional benefit of such a simple exercise is that it forces you to think about your daily routine. Often, we start time-wasting activities, and they become habits. And if you don't become aware of the pointless behavior, it's difficult to break those bad habits. I've found this exercise to be one of the most powerful things in productivity. Start now. Your activity log probably looks something like this:",
